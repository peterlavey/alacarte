# Retrieve plan
Read the contents of requirements.md and create a detailed development plan describing how to implement these requirements.

The plan should include:
- A short overview of the goal.
- The main steps or phases required to achieve it.
- Any dependencies, risks, or considerations to keep in mind.

Do not write or modify any code yet. Save the plan as plan.md.

# Detail of plan
Read the contents of plan.md and generate a detailed, enumerated task list based on it.
Each task should be clear, actionable, and written in a way that allows it to be marked as completed once done.
Maintain a logical order of execution. Group the tasks logically into phases.
Save the result as tasks.md, formatted as a numbered list with checkboxes (for example, - [ ] Implement data repository).
Do not start implementing any tasks yet—only create the list.

# execute tasks
Proceed with the implementation steps for Phase 1 according to the tasks listed in docs/tasks.md.
Mark the tasks as done [x] upon completion

# Spec-Driven Development Prompt

Transform the provided high-level requirements into a complete set of project planning artifacts for spec-driven development.

## Instructions:

You must produce **four files** inside the `docs/` and `.junie/` directories:

- `docs/requirements.md`
- `docs/plan.md`
- `docs/tasks.md`
- `.junie/guidelines.md`

Follow the methodology below step by step:

---

### Step 1: Create `docs/requirements.md`

- Title: **Requirements Document**
- Introduction: Summarize the application purpose and key functionality.
- Requirements section:

    - Use sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, …).
    - Each requirement must include:
        - **User Story** in the format:

          > As a user, I want [goal] so that [benefit/reason]

        - **Acceptance Criteria** in the format:

          > WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [expected behavior]

- Guidelines:

    - Focus on user goals and benefits.
    - Make acceptance criteria specific, testable, and precise.
    - Cover normal flows, edge cases, error handling, persistence, and UI/UX.
    - Group related requirements logically.

---

### Step 2: Create `docs/plan.md`

- Analyze `docs/requirements.md`.
- Develop a **detailed implementation plan**:
    - Link each plan item explicitly to the corresponding requirements.
    - Assign priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    - Group related plan items logically.
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements.

---

### Step 3: Create `docs/tasks.md`

- Based on the implementation plan in `docs/plan.md`, produce a **detailed enumerated technical task list**:

    - Each task must have a placeholder `[ ]` to mark completion.
    - Link each task both to:
        - the development plan item in `docs/plan.md`
        - the related requirement(s) in `docs/requirements.md`
- Group tasks into **development phases**.
- Organize phases logically (e.g., Setup → Core Features → Advanced Features → Testing & QA).

---

### Step 4: Update `.junie/guidelines.md`

- Add **concise technical instructions** on how to work with the `docs/tasks.md` checklist.
- Instructions should include:
    - Mark tasks as `[x]` when completed.
    - Keep phases intact but add new tasks if needed.
    - Ensure every new or modified task stays linked to a requirement and plan item.
    - Keep formatting consistent with the existing style.

## Input:

[INSERT YOUR HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE APPLICATION YOU WANT TO CREATE; ASK THE USER]

## Output:

1. `docs/requirements.md` – structured requirements document
2. `docs/plan.md` – implementation plan with priorities and links
3. `docs/tasks.md` – detailed enumerated task list grouped into phases
4. `.junie/guidelines.md` – updated concise instructions for working with the task list
