# Production settings for Vite (GitLab Pages + deployed API)

# IMPORTANT:
# Set this value to your publicly reachable API base URL, e.g.,
#   https://<your-domain-or-host>/
# If you don't want to commit the real URL, set CI/CD variable
# VITE_API_BASE in GitLab and it will override this value at build time.

VITE_API_BASE=https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_BASE
